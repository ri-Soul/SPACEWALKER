## SEASON 1: WAR BETWEEN HUMANS 2101:  
- *INTRO: From the industrial Revolution we started to burn fossil fuels and kill more trees and more animals. Thats why there is global warming and to much carbon dioxide.  There is a shortage of food and oxygen, so the only solution is less people, only then a few(1/40 000) will survive. We started to be more a plague than a kind.  We started a war because nobody wanted to die and everyone fighted against each other, the earth became a chaos. The Soviet Union was able to get back together.*
